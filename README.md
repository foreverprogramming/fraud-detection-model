# Fraud Detection Model

This project is for educational purposes and simulates the workflow of building a model to detect fraudulent transactions.

To train and test the model we use synthetic data generated to simulate a real-world scenario. Because the data are versioned with DVC and stored remotely on Google Drive, anyone running this code will need to download the dataset from [[source]](https://datastackapi.com/dataset/credit-card-transactions-fraud-detection) and place the files in the `data` folder.

Keep in mind that, due to the nature of the dataset, this model may not be appropriate for real-world use.
